Hi! I'm Shreya Musini. I am a current MS student at UCSD studying Computer Science with a depth in AI. I received my BS in Cognitive Science with a Specialization in Machine Learning and Neural Computation with a minor in Data Science. 
I'm interested in applying Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning to fields like healthcare. I'm seeking Summer 2026 internships in ML/AI engineering or data science. Check out my projects below and feel free to reach out!
